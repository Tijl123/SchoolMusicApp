# MusicApp

## Description
MusicApp is a web application that allows you to find information on any piece
of music you can think of, ranging from basic metadata like track name, artist
information and album release date to lyrics and even sheet music. You can also
upload unknown mp3 files and let the service identify them!

## Usage
Either use our public instance (TBD) or host one yourself using the deployment
instructions.

## Deployment
TBD, we may consider creating a docker-compose file.

## Contributing
Since this is a school project, we do not accept contributions. Feel free to
open an issue when you run into any bugs, though!
