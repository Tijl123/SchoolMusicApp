# MusicApp

## Description
MusicApp is a web application that allows you to find information on an album, track or artist. It makes use of a big database, so you will most likely find the music you are looking for.

## Content

The back-end is connected with an ElephantSQL-database and a MongoDB NoSQL-database.

## Installation
